            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
            My name is Rebecca Lehew (she/her). I am a UX-focused web developer completing my training through the University of Kansas Coding Boot Camp. I will receive my certificate at the end of May 2023. I bring to the table 12 years of experience in public school education and public school libraries. My experience in education equates to years of problem-solving, an eye for detail, the ability to collaborate with others towards a common goal, creativity, and flexibility. When I'm not working, you will find me with a book in hand, walking the dog, spending time with family, traveling to national parks, or all of the above. I look forward to working with you!

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>
                I enjoy problem solving and collaboration; I thrive in a team environment! I have a working knowledge of front end development and am growing my knowledge of back end development. My most recent team project, Rad-Libs, is a full stack application that utilizes a responsive front end styled with Bootstrap and an Express back end. Our team worked through the GitHub work flow and used GitHub Issues to organize tasks. My role included assisting with page routes and inserting the middleware on the back end and creating and styling the handlebars.js templates with Bootstrap on the front end, displaying data objects in a rad way to the user.
