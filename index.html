            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
            My name is Rebecca Lehew (she/her). I am a future web developer completing my training through the University of Kansas bootcamp program. I bring to the table 12 years of experience in public school education and public school libraries. I have an eye for details and enjoy collaborating with others towards a common goal. When I'm not working, you will find me with a book in hand, walking the dog, spending time with family, traveling in a skoolie, or all of the above. I look forward to working with you!

            <h2>Work</h2>
            <p>
                I enjoy problem solving and collaboration; I thrive in a team environment! I have a working knowledge of html, CSS, and JavaScript. At the completion of my bootcamp, I will also be familiar with API's, responsive design, node, OOP, and more. Recently, I completed a project in refactoring code, debugging lines of code, making all images accessible, and streamlining the lines of code to conventional standards.
