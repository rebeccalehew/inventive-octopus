# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio


## Description

The given assignment is to build a responsive online portfolio showcasing my work to future employers. The assignment provided multiple acceptance criterias, noteably requiring a responsive application, use of CSS variables, and use of the hover property. The application I created reflects my current abilities in html and CSS. Through creating this application, I learned that flexbox is my growing edge. After the holidays, I plan to schedule a tutoring session to go over flexbox and the basic capabilities. As I progress in my knowledge, I plan to continue updating and improving my portfolio for maximum employment potential.


## Usage

This online portfolio will be used by me indefinitely as potential employers like to see work samples. As I learn more, I will update my portfolio to best showcase my knowledge, creativity, and talent.

As is, this application can be used by potential employers to learn about myself, view work samples, and contact me via email, LinkedIn, and GitHub.

## Credits

I used a large variety of articles from W3Schools to boost my knowledge in creating this application, especially regarding the topics of Media Queries, Flexbox, and CSS variables. I also used the code provided in the week 1 challenge as a starting point, changing colors, images, elements, properties, etc. to meet my current needs.
